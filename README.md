# You can try English Dictionary on Vercel!
English Dictionary is a user-friendly web application designed to enhance vocabulary learning and word exploration. This application is divided into three main sections, catering to different aspects of dictionary usage and vocabulary building. Whether you are a student, a language enthusiast, or simply looking to expand your English vocabulary, this application provides a comprehensive and engaging experience.

### ðŸ“š This application offers a wide array of features across its three sections:

## 1. Search Word
**Word Search:** Quickly look up any English word to access its definition, part of speech, and related information.

**Save Word:** Bookmark words that you want to revisit or learn later. Saved words are stored for offline access within the application.

**Part of Speech Grouping:** Definitions are categorized and presented according to their part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective), providing a structured understanding of word usage.

**Pronunciation in Different Accents:** Listen to the pronunciation of words in various accents, aiding in accurate pronunciation and improving listening skills.

**Synonyms and Antonyms:** Explore synonyms (words with similar meanings) and antonyms (words with opposite meanings) for a richer understanding of word relationships and context.

**Definition Examples:** Definitions are enhanced with example sentences to illustrate word usage in context.
